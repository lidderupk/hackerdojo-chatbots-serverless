# Dive into chatbots- a beginner hands on workshop

Chatbots are the new craze, but it takes a good understanding of dialogs and communication to design and implement a usable chatbot. Join IBM Developer SF's hands on workshop and learn about the underlying principles of a chatbot in this talk and then build one from scratch.

In this talk, you will learn the anatomy of a good chatbot and how the various pieces fit together. We will look at:

- Intents: to convey purpose or goal
- Entities: make logical decisions based on user input
- Dialogs: design a conversation
- Slots: collect important information to fulfill an intent
- Digressions and Handlers: handle unexpected conversations
- Analytics: improve chatbot on an ongoing basis using metrics
- Integrating with other cognitive services via serverless (time permitting)
